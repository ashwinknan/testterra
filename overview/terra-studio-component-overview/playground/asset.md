# Asset

The Asset section serves as a dedicated space for storing and managing 3D objects. It offers developers a central place to organize, import, and use these assets within their game projects, streamlining the development workflow.

Selecting "Asset" from the Builder Menu brings up the Asset Builder Panel in the Builder Panel, which features two main views: Library and In-Scene.

## Library View

You can perform the following actions  with the Library View:

* **Add a Pre-made Asset**: To include a pre-made asset in your game, simply click on the desired asset, then drag and drop it into the game workspace. The In-Scene View will update to show a list of all assets you've added.
* **Search for a Pre-made Asset**: Use the Asset Search Bar to find specific assets by typing in their names.
* **Filter Assets**: Assets can be filtered by theme or category tags, making it easier to find what you need

{% hint style="info" %}
:dart:  Currently you cannot import your own assets in the game. However, in an upcoming release cycle, you'll be able to upload your assets directly into the Terra Studio environment, making it easier than ever to personalise your games and bring your unique visions to life.
{% endhint %}

## In-Scene View

The In-Scene view lists all the assets you've selected and placed in your game workspace, allowing for easy tracking and management of your game's 3D objects.
