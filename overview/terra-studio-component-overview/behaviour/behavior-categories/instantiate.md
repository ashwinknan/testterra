# Instantiate

The Instantiate behavior template helps to dynamically spawn the <mark style="color:purple;">same object</mark> in <mark style="color:purple;">different locations</mark> during gameplay. It enables controlled timing and quantity of object spawns.&#x20;

You can define where objects appear in the game scene by specifying a range of X, Y, and Z coordinates or by randomizing their location within a designated area. With the first method, you have precise control over the specific combinations of coordinates where objects will spawn. Alternatively, using the random allocation option, you can define an area using the record feature, allowing objects to appear randomly within that area during gameplay.

To add this behavior, follow these steps:&#x20;

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Step 1</mark>: Select the object or trigger to which you want to apply this template
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Step 2</mark>: Enter the following parameters to customize the behavior:

| Per x second           | You can set the time interval, measured in seconds, for when objects will respawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Randomise              | This parameter is specifically for locators. It causes objects to spawn at the specified coordinates, but the order of the coordinates will be randomized, disregarding the order in which they were defined.                                                                                                                         |
