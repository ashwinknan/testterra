# Switch

The switch behavior template allows you to `control the behaviors` of the objects. The object can be  `one you are interacting` with or `a different object`. You can send broadcasts to `activate` or `deactivate` behaviors based on the triggers for each action.

For example, a cube has a switch behavior attached to it. When the player collides with the cube, an '`on-broadcast`' signal is sent to the laser, `initiating its rotation`. Conversely, when you click on the cube, an '`off-broadcast`' signal is sent to the laser, `halting its rotation.`

To add the behavior to an object:

Step 1: Select the object

Step 2: Click on Add Behavior in the Inspector Panel and select Switch from the collection of behaviors:
