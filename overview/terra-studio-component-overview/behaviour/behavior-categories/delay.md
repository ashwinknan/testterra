# Delay

The delay template allows you to add a <mark style="color:yellow;">few seconds of delay</mark> in between the broadcasts which eventually creates a gap of a few seconds between two different events. Usually, events happen instantly as soon as they receive the broadcast but with the help of a delay behavior template, you can add a delay between two events.

To add this behavior, follow these steps:&#x20;

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Step 1</mark>: Select the object or trigger to which you want to apply this template
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Step 2</mark>: Enter the following parameters to customize the behavior:

<table><thead><tr><th width="279">Parameters</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Listen To</td><td>Choose a broadcast from the drop drop menu. Once the object receives this broadcast, there will be a <mark style="color:purple;"><code>delay created for the next event.</code></mark></td></tr><tr><td>Delay Time</td><td>Define the seconds by how long there will be a delay</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br><code>The broadcast is sent after the defined delay time has completed.</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
