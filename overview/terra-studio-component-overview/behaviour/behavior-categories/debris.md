# Debris

The Debris behavior template serves a vital role in determining the aftermath of destruction within the game environment along with the Debris Destructible behavior. With this behavior, we can define the `object` that will used as `debris after destruction`.

Furthermore, developers can fine-tune the destruction process by adjusting various parameters in the Debris Destructible behavior. Both templates are interdependent.

To add this behavior template:

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step 1</mark>: Select the object that will be destroyed.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step 2</mark>: Click Add Behavior in the Inspector Panel and Choose Debris

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step 3</mark>: You can customize the behaviour according to your requirements:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group     | This creates a group for the object that will help you to connect the debris to Debris Destructible behavior. |
