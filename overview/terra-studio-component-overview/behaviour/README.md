# Behaviour

## Understanding Behaviors in Terra Studio

In Terra Studio, a "behavior" is a key component that allows game developers to bring specific functionalities to life within their projects seamlessly, without any coding knowledge. Each behavior acts as a modular logic block that can be easily assigned to 3D objects through a drag-and-drop interface, followed by a simple configuration to meet the gameâ€™s design requirements.

These behaviors are highly customizable, featuring adjustable parameters that empower developers to fine-tune their games to perfection. At its core, a behavior is defined by its trigger mechanism and the subsequent effect it brings into the gaming environment.

### Trigger Mechanisms

There are two primary categories of triggers:

#### Interaction-Based Triggers

These triggers are activated by direct player interaction within the game world, affecting both static and movable objects. They include:

* **Mouse Clicks:** Actions are initiated by clicking on various elements in the game.
* **Player-Asset Collisions:** Triggered when the player's character interacts with objects.
* **Asset-Asset Collisions:** Activated through interactions between non-player objects.

#### Event-Based Triggers

Alternatively, these triggers respond to specific events within the game, further divided into:

* **Game Event Triggers:** Occur during significant game milestones, like the start of the game.
* **Custom Event Triggers:** Triggered by custom-defined events within the gameplay environment.

### Potential Outcomes

The activation of a trigger can lead to diverse outcomes, such as:

* Modifying player or asset attributes.
* Environmental changes.
* Game system updates.
* Reorientation of game elements.
* Enabling other behaviors.
* Imparting visual or sound effects.
* Creating or eliminating game entities.

### Behavior Categories

To streamline development, behaviors are grouped into three distinct categories:

* **Dependent Behaviors:** Function based on other behaviors or specific events.
* **Independent Behaviors:** Operate without any external dependencies.
* **Joiners:** Serve as a bridge, connecting various behaviors together.

This structured approach to behaviors in Terra Studio significantly eases the game development process, enabling creators to bring their visions to life with greater efficiency and less technical complexity.
