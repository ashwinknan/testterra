# How to add Behaviours ?

You can add a behavior to any object using the following steps, in sequence:&#x20;

* Select the object by clicking on the object, either in the workspace or on the [`Layers Panel`](../../../editor-essentials/builder-menu-and-builder-panel/layers.md)
* Click on **`Add Behaviour`** in the [`Inspector Panel`](../../../editor-essentials/inspector-panel.md) on the right to open up a list of all available behaviour&#x20;
* Select the relevant behaviour and Click **`Done`**.&#x20;
* You can now scroll down the [`Inspector Panel`](../../../editor-essentials/inspector-panel.md) to find the added behaviors and all its customizable parameters
