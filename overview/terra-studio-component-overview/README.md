# Terra Studio Component Overview

Terra Studio is a 3D game engine composed of five main components: Player, Playground, Behavior, Game System, and Game Events. These components interact seamlessly to offer a comprehensive platform for the development of diverse games.

By using these components in the right combination, you can create almost any game that Terra Studio supports.

### Player

The player is defined by two types of properties:

* **Primary Properties**: These include Spawn Position, Spawn Orientation, Spawn Scale, Gameplay Controller, and Camera.
* **Behavior Specific Properties**: These are properties specific to the behavior of the player.

### Playground

The playground represents the interactive environment for the player, comprising Objects (Assets, SFX, Particles) and the Environment (GlobalRenderSettings). Each element within this space features two categories of editable properties:

* **Global Properties**
* **Behavior Specific Properties**

### Behaviour

Behaviors are linked to the playground element - Asset. They dictate the behavior of the asset when specific conditions are met. These behaviors are highly customizable.&#x20;

Fundamentally, a behavior is characterized by its trigger mechanism and the subsequent effect (Broadcast) it introduces into the gaming environment. A behavior can be dependent, independent, or a joiner of different behaviors.

### Game System

#### 1. Primitive Game System

These are overall systems that are part of the gameplay but are not attached to any playground element. There are two main primitive game systems: Score and Timer.

#### 2. Complex Game System

These are systems that influence gameplay but are a combination of primitive game systems and properties of Player, Playground Elements, and Behaviors.

Few examples of complex game systems:

1. Level Mapper: Defines how any property of an asset or properties changes when a certain Primitive Game System is in effect.
2. Game Progress: Shows a UI (a behavior) based on progress in the Score or Timer.

### Game Events:

These are the occurrences generated by player interaction with the playground. Examples include: Clicking on an element, Moving the player to a position, Colliding with another element, Broadcasting a signal.

### How to define game rules?

Essentially, the mechanics or rules of the game can be established through the combination of game components such as game systems and behaviors. For instance, if I want to reset the player's score to zero every time they collide with a specific type of obstacle, this can be achieved using the "reset score" behavior and the "score" game system.
