# Game Systems

#### 1. Primitive Game System

These are overall systems that are part of the gameplay but are not attached to anything in the playground. There are two main primitive game systems: Score and Timer.

#### 2. Complex Game System

These are systems that influence gameplay but are a combination of primitive game systems and properties of Player, Playground Elements, and Behaviors.

Few examples of complex game systems:

1. Level Mapper: Defines how any property of an asset or properties changes when a certain Primitive Game System is in effect.
2. Game Progress: Shows a UI (a behavior) based on progress in the Score or Timer.

### Primitive Game Systems

These are the foundational systems that underpin basic gameplay mechanics. They cover essential functions such as:

* **Timer System:** Manages the time-related aspects within the game, including countdowns or time-limited challenges.
* **Scoring System:** Keeps track of players' scores, critical for competition and progression.
*

### Advanced Game Systems

Building upon the primitive systems, advanced systems introduce complexity and a richer layer of gameplay through:

* **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: Tailors the game's difficulty based on the player's performance.
* **AI Behavior Systems**: Dictate the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs), enhancing realism.
* **Economy Systems**: Govern in-game currencies and economies, adding a strategic layer to the game.
* **Asset Upgrade System:** Allows for the enhancement or modification of game assets, contributing to the depth of gameplay.
