# Camera Controls

You can achieve different views of the scene using the camera control.

There are 6 different orientations provided to the user:

* **`Top`** - This allows you to view and edit the scene from the **top view** of the camera.
* **`Bottom`** - This allows you to view and edit the scene from the **bottom view** of the camera.
* **`Left`** - This allows you to view and edit the scene from the **left view** of the camera.
* **`Right`** - This allows you to view and edit the scene from the **right view** of the camera.
* **`Front`** - This allows you to view and edit the scene from the **front view** of the camera.
* **`Back`** - This allows you to view and edit the scene from the **back view** of the camera.

### Projections Control

You have access to two different projections of the scene:

* **`Perspective Projection`**: This will help you to feel the depth of the elements while considering the distance with respect to the viewer.
* **`Orthographic Projection`**: This maintains the uniform scaling of the elements irrespective of the distance.

### Custom Orientation

To achieve a custom orientation of the camera, you can right-press on your mouse, and move the cursor adjusting to your preferred orientation.
