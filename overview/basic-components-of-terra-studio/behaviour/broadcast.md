The Broadcast Property is a communication tool within our game editor that enables interactive and dynamic relationships between objects in your game. This feature allows one object to send out a signal (broadcast) and other objects to respond to this signal by changing their behaviour or performing specific actions.

This system of broadcasting and listening enables you to create complex, interactive environments where objects can influence each other's state and behaviour, making your game more immersive and dynamic.
