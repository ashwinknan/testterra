# Self-service customer

Self-service customers are a distinctive behavior type frequently employed in Tycoon Games. They allow creators to simulate customer actions using NPC assets, particularly in self-service stores. For instance, applying the Self-service customer behavior to a "bunny" visiting a store to purchase 5 apples, 6 eggs, and 2 bananas would prompt the NPC to enter the store, locate the respective shelves, collect the desired items, proceed to the checkout counter for billing, and finally, complete the transaction to obtain the items.

To add the Self-service customers behavior to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Select the asset you wish to apply the Self-service customers behavior to.
2. In the Inspector panel, click on **Add Behavior**.
3. From the list of behaviors, choose **Self-service customers.**

You can customize the below-mentioned parameters according to your requirements:
