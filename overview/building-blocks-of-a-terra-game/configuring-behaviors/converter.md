# Converter

Converters are a distinct type of behavior frequently employed in Tycoon Games. They grant creators the ability to assign behaviors to assets, allowing them to transform one type of asset into another. For instance, by applying the Converter behavior to a "coffee grinding machine," it gains the capability to produce ground coffee and package it into bags at a set rate.

To add the Converter behavior to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Select the asset you wish to apply the Converter behavior to.
2. In the Inspector panel, click on **Add Behavior**.
3. From the list of behaviors, choose **Converter.**

You can customize the below-mentioned parameters according to your requirements:
