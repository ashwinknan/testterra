# Rotate

Objects that have Rotate Behavior Template attached to them start rotating along their axis on a trigger. There can be multiple triggers to activate the rotation.&#x20;

You can rotate the objects in different axes with different speeds and in different directions according to the game requirements.

You can customise the parameters of the template as follows:
