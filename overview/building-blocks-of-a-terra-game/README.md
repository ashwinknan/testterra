# Building Blocks of a Terra Game

Any game in Terra consists of four basic blocks -  Player, Game Scene, Behaviour and Game System.&#x20;

## Player

At the core of any game in Terra lies the "Player" block, which is the graphical avatar representing players in the game world. This block is customisable through a collection of editable features known as "Player Properties".

## Game Scene

Having a player isn't enough for a game. You need a scene where the player can explore and interact. Game Scene blocks let you build this world. Without them, the player would just have a big empty space. There are four main types of Game Scene blocks:

* The "Asset" block - Any 3D object that is part of the game's world.&#x20;
* The "SFX" block - Any sound effect  that is added to the game
* The "Particle" block - Any visual graphical effect simulating anything from fire to rain to enhance the visual appeal and realism of the game
* The "Environment" block**:** This refers to the global settings that affect the overall look of the game space. Includes lighting, camera perspectives, and global shaders that give the game its unique atmosphere.

Each of these blocks is customizable & configurable through an associated set of editable properties. &#x20;

## Behaviour

Simply having a Player block and a Game Scene Object block won't create an engaging game experience. Interactivity is key, and this is where Behavior blocks play a pivotal role. They are the essence of gameplay, turning a static scene into an immersive, interactive world. Behavior blocks are always added to Asset Blocks. That way you can program Asset blocks to follow specific instructions, enabling interactivity in the game in precisely the ways you want.

Integrating Behavior blocks into your game transforms the game into dynamic, interactive elements. Without Behavior blocks, you're left with a mere navigation through static scenes. It's the Behavior blocks that turn these scenes into a captivating game.

## Game System

Creating an engaging game requires more than just setting up Behavior blocks for individual Asset blocks. It's essential to establish a broader framework that outlines the game's fundamental mechanics and rules. This is achieved through the Game System block. Unlike the Behavior block, which dictates how specific assets react, the Game System block influences the entire game's operation.

Game Systems can be divided into two categories:

* **Primitive**: These are the basic systems that handle elementary functions such as timing (e.g., countdowns, time limits), scoring (e.g., points awarded for achievements). They are fundamental to almost all games and provide the necessary structure for more complex systems to build upon.
* **Advanced**: These involve more sophisticated mechanics that can include progression mechanics (e.g., levels, unlocking features) AI behavior and economy systems (e.g., currency, trade)

## Game Signals

Game Signals are not really blocks but rather a mechanism for different blocks to communicate. Common game signals are Game Win , Game Lose or Custom Broadcast&#x20;

### Game Win

It is the signal generated when the player meets the win condition for a game

### Game Lose

It is the signal generated when the player meets the lose condition for a game

### Custom Broadcast

In Terra Studio, the most crucial tool is a custom broadcast signal. This lets you send a unique alert whenever a specific game condition happens. You can name each custom signal differently.

#### Generating a Broadcast Signal

The Custom Broadcast can be generated by any Behavior, any SFX, any Particle or any Game System. Each broadcast signal is identified by a unique name that you can give it.&#x20;

#### Listening to a Broadcast Signal

Creating a Custom Broadcast isn't enough on its own. It becomes valuable only when there are broadcast listeners set up to receive it. In Terra Studio, Behavior blocks, Sound SFX, Particles, and Game Systems can all "listen" for these broadcast signals.

Multiple listeners can all receive and act on the same broadcast signal at the same time. However, a single behavior can only create one broadcast. If an asset has more than one behavior, it can send out multiple broadcasts, one for each behavior.

## Scripts

You can enable behaviors, game systems, or modify the player using custom scripts in Terra's coding language, T#. With T#, you can write your code to achieve your desired interactions.

## Summary

Games are built using several types of blocks:

* **Player Block**: Represents the character avatar you control.
* **Game Scene Blocks**: Construct the environment of the game.
* **Behaviour Blocks**: Make elements interactive, allowing you to engage with the world.
* **Game System Blocks**: Define the rules and dynamics that keep the game enjoyable and challenging, such as scoring and difficulty progression.

You can enable and modify Game Signals, Behaviors, and Game Systems using custom scripts written in T#. These scripts can communicate with each other through Game Signals to create cohesive and dynamic gameplay experiences.
