# Getting Access

### We're in Closed Beta

Every team is different - different architectures, different asset structures, different team setups. We want to be thoughtful about working with the right teams initially to make sure Flow integrates perfectly with their specific needs and workflow.

Instead of building a one-size-fits-all solution, we're working directly with Unity teams to understand how they currently handle UI creation, performance debugging, analytics, and deployments. This lets us make Flow enhance their existing workflow rather than disrupt it.

We're also learning from each team we work with, which helps us build something that solves real problems that Unity developers actually face.

### Requesting Access

{% hint style="info" %}
To get access, schedule a 30-minute call at [cal.com/terra-demo/30min](https://cal.com/terra-demo/30min)
{% endhint %}

We'll discuss your project and see if Flow is a good fit. If it is, we'll personally set up Flow for your project and walk you through how it works with your specific codebase.

We handle all the installation, configuration, and integration work. You focus on your game, we focus on making Flow work seamlessly for your team.

The process typically takes 3-5 days from first contact to having Flow fully integrated and running in your Unity project.

### Requirements

Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer and an active project you want to improve. That's it.
