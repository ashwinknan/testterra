# üó∫ Asset Atlas

Asset Atlas is the intelligence layer for your game project ‚Äî a complete **knowledge graph of every asset, dependency, and system** in your build. It not only answers the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of your assets, but also surfaces the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù behind your design choices.&#x20;

Atlas automatically understands your Unity project so you can ask it questions and get instant answers about your code, assets, and how things connect.

{% hint style="info" %}
**You ask:** "What scripts are in my project and how are they organized?"

**Atlas answers:** Shows your actual folder structure, script names, and how they relate to each other
{% endhint %}

Asset Atlas makes every project instantly _understandable, navigable, and explainable_.

* **Universal Index**: Every asset, script, prefab, shader, and UI element automatically indexed and mapped.
* **Semantic Queries**: Ask in natural language and receive precise answers (dependencies, unused assets, performance bottlenecks, etc.).
* **System Summaries**: Auto-generate high-level views of game flows, progression, monetization, and analytics.
* **Design Intelligence**: Turn raw technical data into Game Design Document (GDD)-quality outputs.
* **Cross-Team Utility**: Developers see references & performance issues, designers see economy balance & progression flows, producers see status and risks.

### How Atlas Works

{% step %}
#### **Automatic Connection**

Atlas detects your Unity project when you open Flow. No setup required.

_What you see:_ Project name, Unity version, connection progress

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Project Indexing**

_What you see:_

* Real-time progress (scripts, prefabs, textures being processed)
* File names streaming by as they're analyzed
* "Indexing complete" when done

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Ready to Chat**

Atlas scans through all your files to understand your project structure and once done, chat input becomes active. Atlas now knows about every asset in your project.

_What you see:_ "Atlas is ready! Ask me anything about your project."

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Ask Questions**&#x20;

Type normal questions about your project in the chat &&#x20;

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Get smart answers**

Atlas responds with specific information about _your_ project.

{% endstepper %}

### Technical Notes

**No Setup Required**

* Automatically connects to your Unity project
* Read-only access (never modifies your files)
* Works in background without affecting Unity

**Project Coverage**

* Indexes all scripts, prefabs, textures, materials
* Maps dependencies and relationships
* Updates automatically when you make changes

_Atlas is part of Flow - the Unity-native AI copilot for LiveOps teams. No coding required, just natural conversation about your Unity project._
