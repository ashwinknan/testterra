# Account Management

### Overview

Flow accounts are set up per studio, with a designated admin who controls team access and manages usage. Multiple team members can use Flow under the studio account.

### Getting Your Studio Account

After your studio requests beta access and completes onboarding, we create your Flow account and designate the admin. The admin receives login credentials and can immediately start managing the account.

### Team Access

Flow has no seat limits on any pricing plan. The admin can add as many team members as needed from your studio domain.

### Admin Capabilities

The studio admin can:

* Add team members by email address (no limits on team size)
* Remove team member access anytime
* View detailed usage reports showing who used which features when
* Manage billing and credit purchases
* See current credit balance and team activity

### Adding Team Members

Team members must have an email address matching your studio domain (like @yourstudio.com) and must be explicitly added by the admin. Once added, they receive access confirmation and can sign in using Google Auth SSO.

### How Team Members can start using Flow

1. **Admin adds them** to the Flow account
2. **Install Flow plugin** in their Unity project
3. **Connect Flow** to their Unity project
4. **Start using** Flow features immediately

### Usage and Billing

All team member usage counts toward your studio account. When anyone on your team uses Flow features like UI Builder, Profiler, or Analytics Ninja, it deducts from your studio's shared credit balance.

You pay for usage, not per team member. The admin can see exactly who used what features and when.

### Authentication

All studio members sign in using Google Auth SSO with their  Google account. No separate passwords needed - it uses your existing Google workspace authentication.
