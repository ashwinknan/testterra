### How Credits Work

#### Credit System Basics

Flow uses credits to track task completions. **Different tasks require different amounts of credits.**

**Hot Deploy & Profiler**: 1 credit per task\
**UI Importer**: 2 credits per task\
**Analytics Ninja**: 1-2 credits depending on query complexity and visualization

**Success-Focused system**: Our goal is to make sure you are able to finish your tasks. Unlike other tools that charge for every attempt, Flow gives you multiple tries at the same task to maximize your chances of success.

**Shared Studio Pool**: All team members use credits from your studio's shared balance. The admin account manages and monitors this shared pool.

#### When Credits Are Charged

* **Before starting**: Flow shows the credit cost upfront
* **Multiple attempts**: You get up to 3 attempts at the same task intent
* **After completion**: Credits deducted only when the task finishes (successfully or after max attempts)
* **Forgiving retries**: Same task, multiple tries, one credit charge

### Monitoring Your Usage

#### Admin Account Visibility

**Only admins can see full usage details**:

* Total studio credit balance and remaining credits
* Detailed breakdown by team member (who used what when)
* Usage history by feature type (UI Builder, Profiler, Analytics)
* Daily/weekly/monthly usage trends
* Credit consumption patterns across the team

#### Team Member View

* **In Unity**: Current balance shown in Flow dashboard header
* **Personal History**: Window → Flow → Account shows individual usage history

#### Usage History

Admins can see:

* Which team member used credits when
* What features consumed credits (UI Builder, Profiler, etc.)
* Number of attempts made per task (up to 3 attempts per credit)

### Managing Credits

#### Buying Credits

1. Contact [support@letsterra.com](mailto:flow@letsterra.com) to purchase additional credit packages
2. Credits are added to your studio account after wire transfer processing
3. All team members share the same credit pool

_Note: We're currently integrating direct payment methods for Flexible and Enterprise plans_

#### Credit Consumption

**Before each task**, Flow shows the credit cost. You can:

* Proceed with the task (credits deducted after completion)
* Cancel if you want to save credits
* See exactly what you're paying for upfront

#### Low Credit Alerts

Admins can configure notifications during onboarding:

* Set custom threshold for low-credit warnings (e.g., 5 or 10 credits remaining)
* Admin receives email when threshold is reached
* Team members see low-credit warnings in Unity
* Account temporarily pauses new tasks at 0 credits

### Team Usage Management

#### Admin Controls

* View which team members are using the most credits
* See usage patterns by feature (UI Builder vs. Profiler vs. Analytics)
* Track daily/weekly usage trends
* Export usage reports for budgeting

#### Team Member View

* See current studio credit balance
* View their personal usage history
* Check credit costs before starting tasks
