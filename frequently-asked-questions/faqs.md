However, we are working towards this and you soon will be able to upload your assets directly into the Terra Studio environment.                                                                                               |

| Is there an auto-save option?                                                                                                     | While our studio does offer an auto-save feature, we highly recommend manually saving your progress. We understand the value of your hard work and want to ensure you don't lose any of it. You can easily save your program by clicking on the save icon located in the main toolbar. |
| Do I have access to all the assets, templates, and materials used in the game on my local machine for later use or use elsewhere? | No, you do not have access to those assets locally. However, your progress is saved locally and it can only be accessed using Terra Studio.                                                                                                                                            |
