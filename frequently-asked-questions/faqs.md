| I am developing a runner game where the goal is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles. I want to incorporate "nitro-boost" power-ups that increase the player's speed by 10. However, to balance this advantage, I want "barriers" to appear in the player's path within 10 seconds of the player collecting a nitro-boost. How can I achieve this?                                                                                                                                                            | In the game builder panel, navigate to "Essentials" and select "Player Controller Drawer." In the inspector, set the player's initial speed to the desired starting value. To set different upgraded speed levels, create a level mapper. Click the "Essentials" icon in the toolbar and choose "Level Mapper" to define values for each level. If the power-ups should be free, set the cost to 0. Return to the Player Controller Drawer and set player speed to "Multi-level." Link the newly created level mapper to the player speed settings. To set up collectible power-ups, add an asset and apply the "collectible" behavior to it. Add the "Level Up" game system and assign the same level mapper to the power-up. In the "Start" field, enter "Player Collide." To introduce obstacles when the player's speed increases, use the broadcast and listen. Broadcast a custom message from the Level Up or Collectible behaviour. Add an "instantiate" behaviour to the desired obstacles. Set the start condition to your custom broadcast message and define the points and number of obstacles you want to create.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| I am designing an escape-the-room game. In this game, each level consists of a layout with 11 interconnected rooms. Each room contains a key, but these keys are guarded by enemy characters that will send you back to the first room upon contact. The 11th room contains an exit portal that opens only when all 10 keys are collected, allowing you to progress to the next level. If you attempt to open the portal before collecting all 10 keys, a UI message saying "All Keys Not Collected" should be displayed. How can I achieve this? | To implement this in your game, start by adding collectible functionality to each key hidden in the rooms. Update a custom score each time a key is collected. In the essentials panel, select the manager for the custom score type you created and add a special broadcast at a score of 10. This broadcast can be used later to open the portal. To set up your enemy characters, add move or interpolate behavior to your enemy asset and define its movement path. To send the player back to the first room upon contact with an enemy, also add the "kill player" behavior to the enemy. To control the portal's interaction with the player, add a collision behavior to the portal and broadcast a custom message when the player collides with it. Then, add an "And operator" to the portal. This operator will listen for the collision broadcast and the special broadcast from the custom score group. When both conditions are met, trigger a custom output broadcast. Use move behavior to open the portal based on the broadcast from the "And operator." To display a UI message when not enough keys are collected, add an Empty and Collider behaviour to the scene. Attach a "Show UI" behavior to this object, triggering the UI when the player collides with it. Destroy this object with the broadcast from the special broadcast of the score group when all keys are collected. |
