| I am creating a runner game where the objective is to reach the finish line the quickest while avoiding obstacles. I want to create "nitro-boost" power ups in between which increase the player speed by 10, but to neutralise the advantage, I also want "barriers" to appear in the player's path within 10 seconds of the player collecting a nitroboost to slow down the playert.How do I do this? | Go to “Essentials” in the builder panel and select “Player Controller Drawer” In the inspector, set Player Speed as the initial speed value you would want the player to start the level with. To define the values of the different ungraded values for speed, create a level mapper. To do so, click the “essentials” icon in the toobar and create a “Level Mapper” Define the values for each level. If you wish to make these free collectible powerups, you can mention the cost as 0. Go back to Player Controller Drawer and makr player speed as “Multi-level”. Link the created level mapper to it. To set up the collectible power up, add an asset and add “collectible” behaviour to it Add “Level Up” template and assign the same level mapper to this. In the start field, enter “Player Collide” For obstacles to appear when speed is upgraded, you can use broadcast and listen fields. Broadcast a custom message from Level up or Collectible template Add a “instantiate” template to the obstacles you want to appear. Select the start condition as your custom broadcast message. Define the points and number of obstacles you want to create |
