# ðŸŽ¨ Terra Studio UI Systems Overview

Terra Studio Pro fully supports all of Unityâ€™s built-in UI systems. Developers can leverage the complete power of Unityâ€™s UI architecture for both runtime and editor interfaces, without modification. All UI workflows, controls, and toolkits are available and compatible, with the only limitations being those imposed by the T# language runtime.

## ðŸ§° Supported UI Systems

### âœ… UI Toolkit

UI Toolkit is a **modern UI framework** designed for both Editor extensions and runtime UI. Itâ€™s based on familiar web concepts like HTML and CSS, offering a retained-mode system, high performance, and flexible styling.

#### **Features of UI Toolkit:**

* **Visual Tree**: A hierarchical representation of all UI elements.
* **Controls Library**: Standard components such as labels, buttons, sliders, toggles, and dropdowns.
* **Data Binding**: Connects data properties to UI elements.
* **Flexbox Layout Engine**: CSS-like layout system for responsive design.
* **Event System**: Handles clicks, touches, drags, and other interactions.
* **UI Renderer**: Built on Unityâ€™s low-level graphics system.
* **Editor UI Support**: For custom Inspector and window development.
* **Runtime UI Support**: Fully usable in game runtime environments.

#### **Asset Types Used:**

* **UXML**: Markup-based structure, similar to HTML/XML.
* **USS**: Style definitions similar to CSS.

#### **Tools Included:**

* **UI Builder**: Visual interface to design UXML/USS assets.
* **UI Debugger**: Inspect and debug UI like a browser dev console.
* **UI Samples**: Prebuilt controls and templates for reference.

### âœ… Unity UI (uGUI)

The classic **GameObject-based UI system** designed for runtime user interfaces. Fully compatible with Terra Studio.

#### **Key Components:**

* `Canvas`: The root of all uGUI UI.
* `Text`, `Image`: For rendering visuals and text.
* `Button`, `Toggle`, `Slider`, `Dropdown`, `InputField`: Common interactive controls.
* `Panel`, `ScrollView`: For layout and grouping.

**Highlights:**

* Visual design via the Scene view
* Dynamic layout and anchoring
* Rich text rendering
* Built-in event system

## ðŸ§ª Creating UI in Terra Studio

You can create UI using any of the following workflows:

#### ðŸ§± UI Builder

* Create a new UXML asset.
* Drag and drop controls (e.g., Label, Button, Toggle).
* Style with USS files.
* Load the Visual Tree in your scripts.

#### ðŸ“œ UXML

* Define structure in an XML-like format.
* Attach UXML to components via `VisualTreeAsset`.

#### ðŸ’» T# Script

* Use `UnityEngine.UIElements` to define UI programmatically.
* Dynamically add elements like `Label`, `Button`, `Toggle`, etc., to your visual hierarchy.

While Unity UI systems are fully supported in Terra Studio Pro, code implementations should be adapted with T# limitations in mind. Refer to these differences and limitations [here](key-differences-t-versus-c.md)
