# Essentials

Essentials in Terra Studio refer to the core system properties that are essential to the game's functionality and overall experience, but not tied to any specific object or player. These are the overarching settings that affect the game environment and how the player interacts with and progresses through the game.

Some of the Essentials available in Terra Studio are:

* **Global Render Setting**: Customise the visual style of your game's environment with properties like Skybox, Bloom, Vignette, and Fog to create the desired atmosphere.
* **Level Mapper**: Configure the progression system of your game by tracking and managing parameters that determine how players level up and advance.
* **Player Properties**: Access and edit physics-based attributes such as maximum speed, acceleration, and gravity to refine how the player controls feel in the game.
* **In-Game Timer**: Implement a countdown or count-up timer to add time-based challenges or events within your gam
