# Scene Panel

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is a Work in Progress. Expect more details soon.&#x20;

The Scene Panel enables users to create and manage multiple scenes in a game project, facilitating organization and seamless transitions. It streamlines the process of creating new scenes, each serving as modular components for different aspects of the game, optimizing performance and enhancing development efficiency.

Once you click on `Scene` in the `Builder Menu`, the `Scene Builder panel` shows all the `Scenes` in that project.

## Add a new Scene&#x20;

* To add a new scene to the project, click on `Scene` in the Builder Menu, the Builder panel opens up.
* On the **top right of the builder panel**, click on `Add New Scene`.&#x20;
* You can define the name of the scene in the pop-up box.
* Clicking on Create button will create a new scene and you can **view** it in the builder panel.

## Switch to different scenes

To switch between multiple scenes, click on the scene from the builder panel and it will switch to that particular scene.

When you switch between scenes, our Studio **auto-saves** your current work!

## Copy a scene

To duplicate any scene, use the copy symbol present at the right of the scene name in the Builder Panel. You will have to rename the copied scene just like how you create a new scene.
