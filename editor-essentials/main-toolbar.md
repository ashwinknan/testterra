This is the `Main Toolbar` that has various functionalities to it. These functionalities range from system properties to publishing the game on Studio. All these have been explained below:

## Primitive Elements

This contains a collection of primitive elements which can be used to customize an asset according to your needs.

A few of the elements are:&#x20;

* Cube
* Cylinder
* Sphere
* Light etc.

## System Properties

The properties are discussed below:

* Game Timer - Adds a timer to the game.
* Checkpoint -  Adds a checkpoint in the game.
* Level Upgrader - Makes your game multilevel.

## Save your Project

Although our Studio autosaves your work locally, it is equally important to save your progress on the cloud.&#x20;

To save your project to the Cloud, Click on the `Save` icon. It's that easy!

## Play

Once you click on `Play`, the scene changes to the `gameplay mode` of your project. You can use this to check if everything is working as per vision.&#x20;

Don't forget to save your game, before going into the game-play mode.

## Publish

Once you hit the Publish button, your project will be sent for review purposes.&#x20;

Once your project passes our standard procedures, it will be live on our app in 2-4 days.
