# Welcome to Flow

<p align="center"><a href="https://flow.letsterra.com" class="button primary">Visit Website</a></p>

### **Flow is the LiveOps platform you wish you had.**

Flow is your **AI copilot for Unity development** paired with **an innovative run-time deployment engine** that helps you reach every player without an app update. Build better solutions faster, then ensure 100% of your players experience them.

### The Two Problems Flow Solves

#### **Problem 1: Development Bottlenecks Slow You Down**

Finding bugs, optimizing performance, creating UI—manual work that keeps you from building what matters.

#### **Problem 2: Your Best Work Never Reaches All Players**

When you finally ship:

* **20-30% of active players never download the update**
* The rest take **2-3 weeks** to adopt
* Your retention features miss the players who need them most

{% hint style="success" %}
**Flow solves both: AI copilot helps devs  do their best work. Hot Deploy ensures every player experiences it.**
{% endhint %}

### Why AI Copilot + Hot Deploy Changes Everything

#### **AI Tools Alone:**

* Help you build better solutions ✅&#x20;
* But 20-30% of players never experience them ❌
* Takes 3 weeks to reach the rest ❌

#### **Hot Deploy Alone:**

* Reach 100% of players ✅
* But you still do all the heavy lifting manually ❌

#### **Flow = AI Copilot + Hot Deploy:**

* AI accelerates your best work ✅&#x20;
* Every solution reaches 100% of players ✅&#x20;
* At-risk players benefit from your improvements ✅&#x20;

<p align="center"><strong>One platform. Two problems solved</strong></p>

### How Flow Works Together

1. **Build** with Flow's integrated tools (UI Importer, AI Debugger, AI Profiler)
2. **Deploy** via Hot Deploy to 100% of your players
3. **Measure** impact with Analytics Engine
4. **Iterate** based on real player data—deploy again instantly

**The complete workflow: Build → Deploy → Measure → Iterate**

All without app store friction. All reaching 100% of players.
