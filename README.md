# Welcome to Flow

<p align="center"><a href="https://flow.letsterra.com" class="button primary">Visit Website</a></p>

**Flow is the LiveOps companion every Unity dev wishes they had.**\
It plugs directly into your Unity project, understands your data, and keeps track of your live game context—so you can ship faster, debug smarter, and keep players happy without leaving the Editor.

It understands your Unity project, your data, and your live game context. With Flow, you can debug issues, build UI, analyze performance, query gameplay analytics, and even ship code updates—all in a fraction of the time.

By connecting to your Unity project and data sources, Flow indexes your project and continuously stays aware of configurations, events, and player behaviors—so every response is tailored to your live game.

### Why Unity Teams Love Flow

* ⚡ **No More Release Bottlenecks**\
  Push fixes, balance tweaks, and UI changes live—skip the painful release cycle grind.
* 🛠 **Debug With Context**\
  Flow sees what’s happening inside your game and surfaces issues in minutes, not hours.
* 🎮 **Performance From Real Players**\
  Forget test rigs—Flow auto-profiles performance snapshots straight from real player sessions.
* 🔍 **Ask, Don’t Query**\
  “Which ability is overused?” “Where are players dropping out?” Just ask in plain English—Flow translates into charts, insights, and answers.
* 🎛 **One Command Center**\
  Monitor events, test rollouts, and orchestrate LiveOps without juggling tools.

### Flow is built for the Way Unity Devs Work

Flow **feels native**—not bolted on. It speaks your project’s language, knows your configs, and indexes your events. Every suggestion, debug step, and insight is tied to _your_ actual code and data.

👉 Instead of fighting release pipelines and tooling overhead, you focus on what matters: **building, fixing, and shipping games players love.**
