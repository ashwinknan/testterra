## What is Terra Studio Pro?

Terra Studio Pro is a Unity SDK that enables dynamic, run-time modifications to games deployed on the Terra Client Platform. Terra Studio allows developers to make real-time changes to their Unity games without requiring users to manually update their applications. The system automatically manages content bundles, ensuring players always experience the most current version of your game without having to force update.&#x20;

### Terra Studio Pro seamlessly Integrates with Unity

Terra Studio maintains the familiar Unity interface and workflow you already know. As an SDK built specifically for Unity, it integrates directly into the Unity Editor environment, allowing developers to:

* Work with the same Unity tools and components you're accustomed to
* Designate updatable assets using familiar inspector panels
* Maintain your existing development practices with minimal learning curve
* Deploy changes using workflows that mirror standard Unity processes

This native integration means there's no need to learn a completely new systemâ€”if you know Unity, you already understand the fundamentals of working with Terra Studio.
