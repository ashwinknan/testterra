Flow is a Unity-native AI copilot built for LiveOps teams built by Terra.

It understands your Unity project, your data, and your live game context. With Flow, you can debug issues, build UI, analyze performance, query gameplay analytics, and even ship code updates—all in a fraction of the time.

By connecting to your Unity project and data sources, Flow indexes your project and continuously stays aware of configurations, events, and player behaviors—so every response is tailored to your live game.



With Flow, LiveOps teams can:

* **Ship faster**: No more waiting for long app release cycles—push fixes and updates instantly.
* **Debug smarter**: Detect and resolve issues in minutes, not hours.
* **Profile automatically**: Capture performance snapshots directly from real players without manual setup.
* **Understand players instantly**: Ask questions in plain English and get answers, insights, and visualizations powered by your own analytics.
* **Orchestrate LiveOps seamlessly**: Monitor, test, and roll out changes—all from one command centre.

If you encounter any issues or have questions,  drop us a note at [**flow@letsterra.com**](mailto:ashwin@letsterra.com). Our team will respond as quickly as possible. In some cases, we may need to ask follow-up questions to diagnose the root cause, not just the symptom.
