### **Flow is the LiveOps platform you wish you had.**

Flow is your **AI copilot for Unity development** paired with **an innovative run-time deployment engine** that helps you reach every player without an app update. Build better solutions faster, then ensure 100% of your players experience them.

### The Two Problems Flow Solves

#### Problem 1: Development Takes Too Long

Finding bugs, optimizing performance, creating UI—repetitive work that keeps you from solving real player problems.

**How Flow solves it:**\
Flow's AI copilot features handle implementation overhead while you focus on creative decisions:

* [**UI Builder**](product-features/ui-builder.md) transforms Figma designs into Unity UI (30 seconds)
* [**WirePilot**](product-features/wirepilot.md) scaffolds complete game systems from natural language requests and auto-wires components
* [**Asset Atlas**](product-features/asset-atlas.md) indexes your entire Unity project so you can ask questions about any asset or system
* [**AI Profiler**](product-features/auto-profiler.md) identifies bottlenecks from real player sessions

#### Problem 2: Your Solutions Don't Reach At-Risk Players

When you ship via app updates, 30-40% of active players never download them. The rest take 2-3 weeks. Your retention features miss the players most likely to churn.

**How Flow solves it:**\
[**Hot Deploy Engine**](product-features/hot-deploy-engine.md) deploys C# code to 90% of active players without them needing to download an update:

* New progression systems, game mechanics, core features reach everyone
* Players restart once (3 seconds) and experience improvements
* At-risk players who skip updates get retention features when they need them

**Flow solves both: AI copilot helps devs  do their best work. Hot Deploy ensures every player experiences it.**
{% endhint %}

### Why AI Copilot + Hot Deploy Changes Everything

#### **AI Tools Alone:**

* Help you build better solutions ✅&#x20;
* But 20-30% of players never experience them ❌
* Takes 3 weeks to reach the rest ❌

#### **Hot Deploy Alone:**

* Reach 100% of players ✅
* But you still do all the heavy lifting manually ❌

#### **Flow = AI Copilot + Hot Deploy:**

* AI accelerates your best work ✅&#x20;
* Every solution reaches 100% of players ✅&#x20;
* At-risk players benefit from your improvements ✅&#x20;

<p align="center"><strong>One platform. Two problems solved</strong></p>

### How Flow Works Together

1. **Build** with Flow's integrated tools (UI Importer, AI Profiler)
2. **Deploy** via Hot Deploy to 100% of your players
3. **Measure** impact with Analytics Engine
4. **Iterate** based on real player data—deploy again instantly

**The complete workflow: Build → Deploy → Measure → Iterate**

All without app store friction. All reaching 100% of players.
