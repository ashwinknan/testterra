<summary>Can I add logic blocks or a custom script to the Player? </summary>

Currently, you cannot add scripts to the player. In the next update, the entire player hierarchy will be exposed, allowing you to add any needed scripts. However, you will not be able to reorder or delete elements, as this impacts our core code.
