Hot Deploy Engine lets you update your Unity game's code instantlyâ€”even for games already installed on players' devices. Push new features, fix bugs, or adjust game balance without waiting for app store approvals or forcing players to reinstall.

Instead of rebuilding your entire app when you change code, Hot Deploy Engine separates your game logic into "hot-updatable" code that can be changed anytime. Your players get these updates automatically while playing, without interruption.

Hot Deploy Engine works on all Unity platforms and passes app store reviews:

* iOS App Store approval âœ“
* Android Play Store approval âœ“
* Console platforms âœ“
* Desktop platforms âœ“

### What Hot Deploy Engine Does

Hot Deploy Engine is designed to feel invisible during development. You work exactly like you always haveâ€”no special tools, no different workflow, no learning curve.

**Your existing setup just works.**

Open VS Code, make changes, hit F5 to test in Unity Play Mode. Hot Deploy Engine runs alongside your normal development without getting in the way.

Your breakpoints work. Your console logs appear normally. Your performance profiler shows accurate data.

**Debugging feels natural.**

When something breaks, you get the same stack traces you're used to. Whether the error comes from hot code or native code, Unity's console shows you exactly where the problem is.

Your favorite debugging techniquesâ€”Debug.Log, breakpoints, Unity's profilerâ€”all work identically.

**No context switching.**

You don't need to think "is this hot code or native code?" while developing. Write your Mono Behaviours, test them in Play Mode, debug issues the same way.

The only difference is that when you're ready to ship, you can push these changes to live games instantly.

### Example Work Flow

**Simple example:** You want to change your shop price from $9.99 to $7.99 for a flash sale. With Hot Deploy Engine, you edit the code, click deploy, and players see the new price immediatelyâ€”no app update required.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Open any script you wish to edit&#x20;

Let's say your script is as below&#x20;

```csharp
/*
 * Basic Unity shop manager with purchase button and $9.99 price display.
 * Handles button clicks and logs purchase events.
 */
 
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class ShopManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Button purchaseButton;
    public Text priceText;

    void Start()
    {
        priceText.text = "$9.99";
        purchaseButton.onClick.AddListener(OnPurchaseClick);
    }

    void OnPurchaseClick()
    {
        Debug.Log("Purchase initiated");
        // Process purchase logic
    }
}
```

Make changes to any C# script in your project using your normal editor (VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.).

_What you do:_ Normal coding workflowâ€”edit, save, continue working

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Edit Your Script**

Hot Deploy Engine monitors your project and detects when scripts are modified.

```csharp
/*
 * Enhanced shop manager with discount features.
 * Adds 20% off label, reduces price to $7.99, and includes analytics tracking.
 */

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class ShopManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Button purchaseButton;
    public Text priceText;
    public Text discountLabel;

    void Start()
    {
        priceText.text = "$7.99"; // Limited time offer!
        discountLabel.text = "20% OFF!";
        discountLabel.gameObject.SetActive(true);
        purchaseButton.onClick.AddListener(OnPurchaseClick);
    }

    void OnPurchaseClick()
    {
        Debug.Log("Discounted purchase initiated");
        Analytics.TrackEvent("discount_purchase_clicked");
        // Process discounted purchase logic
    }
}
```

_What you see in VS Code:_

* File marked as "Modified" in your editor
* Diff view showing exactly what changed (additions, modifications)
* "Changes detected - ready to deploy" status

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Deploy in Editor with 1 click&#x20;

Hot Deploy prompts you to deploy changes to connected builds.

_What you see:_

* "Deploy UI Changes to Staging(iOS)?" dialog
* Choice to deploy now or later
* Clear indication of which build will be updated

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Live Updates Delivered to Users instantly**

Changes are pushed instantly to the running Unity build.

_What happens:_

* Running game receives update without restart
* Players see changes immediately
* No download, no interruption to gameplay

### How Hot Deploy Works

Hot Deploy Engine uses an AOT+Interpreter system. Your main app contains the "foundation" (Unity engine, core systems, UI frameworks), while your game logic runs as interpreted code that can be updated anytime.

**Performance:** Interpreted code runs at 69%-85% the speed of native code. For most game logic (UI, gameplay systems, business logic), this difference is unnoticeable.

**Memory:** Hot-loaded code uses about 5-6 times more memory than native code for metadata, plus about 1MB per execution thread. Objects themselves use identical memory to native code.

**Compatibility:** Works on all Unity platforms including iOS and Android.

### Setting Up Your Project for Hot Deploy

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Organizing Your Code

Split your project into two parts:

* **Base build:** Unity engine, core systems, third-party plugins, UI frameworks
* **Hot code:** Game logic, content systems, business rules, gameplay mechanics

Your hot code can reference anything in the base build, but not vice versa.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Working with Assets

**GameObjects and Components:** Your hot scripts can attach to any GameObject using `AddComponent()`. Scene objects work normally.

**Prefabs:** Keep prefabs with hot scripts in AssetBundles rather than scenes. This prevents Unity from breaking references during builds.

**ScriptableObjects:** Define ScriptableObjects in hot code and they work exactly like regular ones.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Handle Third Party Plugins

Keep plugins like `UniTask`, `DOTween`, or analytics SDKs in your base build. Reference them from hot code. Don't try to hot-load plugins themselves.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
### Things to remember

1.  #### Reflection

    Reflection works for common Unity operations like `GetType()` and `AddComponent()`, but complex reflection scenarios have \~50% success rate. Test your specific use cases.&#x20;
2.  #### Code Stripping

    IL2CPP may strip types that your hot code needs. Use Unity's link.xml to preserve required types, especially generic types like `List<YourClass>`.
3.  #### Hot Swapping

    To load fresh code, you must restart the app. Live code swapping during gameplay isn't supported.
4.  #### Plugin Restrictions

    Third-party plugins must stay in the base build. Trying to hot-load plugins often causes runtime errors.
{% endhint %}

### Memory and Performance Impact

#### App Size

* Hot Deploy Engine adds **\~175 KB** to your app
* Hot code reduces your app size since game logic is downloaded separately

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have 1MB+ of hot code, using Hot Deploy  will keep it smaller than bundling everything together in the base app
{% endhint %}

#### Runtime Memory

* Each hot assembly uses **\~5.5-6** times its file size in memory for metadata
* Each thread running hot code uses **\~1MB** additional memory
* Objects created by hot code use identical memory to native objects

#### Performance

* Most game logic runs at **70%-90%** of native speed
* UI updates, gameplay systems, and business logic show no noticeable difference

{% hint style="warning" %}
Intensive computation (physics, rendering, audio) should stay in the base build
{% endhint %}

### Multiple Assembly Support

Hot Deploy Engine supports organizing your hot code into multiple assemblies when your project grows complex. This is useful for large games where different teams work on separate systems (like UI, gameplay, and monetization) that need to update on different schedules.

Each assembly operates independentlyâ€”you can update your UI code without touching gameplay systems, or push monetization changes without affecting core mechanics. This gives teams flexibility to ship features at their own pace.

{% hint style="info" %}
The trade-off is complexity: you need to manage dependencies between assemblies and ensure updates don't break compatibility with other systems. Most projects work well with a single assembly initially.
{% endhint %}

### Roadmap & Current Limitations

Some enterprise features aren't built-in yet, but we're actively working on them. Here's what you'll need to handle yourself for now:

**Build Pipeline Integration**&#x20;

You'll need to integrate Hot Deploy Engine into your existing CI/CD pipeline. We're developing streamlined build tools and would love to understand your specific workflow to prioritize features.

**Deployment Management**&#x20;

You're responsible for hosting and distributing your hot updates. This means setting up your own CDN, versioning system, and rollback mechanisms. Managed hosting and automated rollback systems are on our development roadmap.

**Security & Signing**&#x20;

Code signing, encryption, and validation need to be implemented by your team based on your security requirements. We're planning standardized security features for future releases.

**Enterprise Deployment**&#x20;

Complex scenarios like multiple DLLs per platform or staged rollouts require custom development work. We're building more sophisticated deployment options based on customer feedback.
