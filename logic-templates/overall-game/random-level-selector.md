# Random Level Selector

The Random Level Selector Logic Template allows you to randomly load a scene from a list of predefined scenes. It is different from the Load Scene Logic Template because here the scene is chosen randomly from a list of multiple scenes

To add the Random Level Selector logic template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Random Level Selector.
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can thentailor the following parameters in Advanced Mode to match your needs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="264">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>When</td><td><p></p><p>Select When to Load a Random Level from a dropdown<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li>On Game Start</li><li>On Broadcast Listened</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Scenes</td><td>Add a selection of scenes to randomly choose from for loading.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Accessing the Random Level Selector Template using T\#

Currently, there's no T# Wrapper available to customize this logic template beyond the scene editor's capabilities. However, you can write your own code in T# to implement this logic from scratch.
