# Checkpoint

A checkpoint is a designated spot where player progress is saved automatically or manually. These markers allow you to restart the game from that specific point if you fail a challenge, lose a life, or need to pause the game.

To add the checkpoint logic template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Checkpoint under the header "Game".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can customize the below-mentioned parameters according to your requirements:
