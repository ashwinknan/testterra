# Studio Machine

The Studio Machine Template lets you attach custom T# scripts to Assets. This template provides the coding flexibility needed to enable an Asset to interact however you want using T# Code.

To add the Studio Machine Template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Studio Machine under the "Game" Header
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

Once you add Studio Machine to an Asset, you will notice that the Advanced Mode Inspector panel shows a Script Tab and an Object Variable Tab. \


<table><thead><tr><th width="264">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Script</td><td><p></p><p>Select the script to execute from the dropdown list of all T# scripts you have created in the Scripts Tab. You can add only one script to an Asset</p></td></tr><tr><td>Object Variables</td><td>Define object variables like String, Int, Float, and Game Objects. These can be locally referenced in the Scripts attached to the Asset. Only variables declared here can be accessed by the script attached to the Asset.</td></tr></tbody></table>
