# Output/Generator

Output/Generators are a specific type of behaviour commonly utilized in Tycoon Games. T_hey empower creators to assign behaviors to assets, enabling them to produce specific types of assets._ For example, the Generator behavior can be applied to a "coconut tree," granting it the capability to produce coconuts at a predetermined rate.

To create a Generator, follow these steps:

1. Create an empty object.
2. Add the asset that will act as a generator as a child to this empty object.
3. Add the generator behavior to the asset.
4. Add the asset that you want the generator to generate as the child of the generator asset.
5. Add the expected behaviour of the generated asset. (carriable)

You can customize the below-mentioned parameters of generator behaviour according to your requirements:
